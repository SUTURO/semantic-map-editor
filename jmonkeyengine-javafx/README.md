Embed JME into JavaFX!

For scientific, industrial or game development use, embedding jMonkeyEngine into JavaFX allows you to make complete use
of JavaFX as a GUI whilst utilizing jMonkeyEngine to visualize your data in a JavaFx Component.

The output of jMonkeyEngine is rendered to a JavaFX ImageView component that you can put anywhere in your JavaFx scene,
and includes automatic resizing to fit the size of its parent.
